# SENG440 - Color Space Conversion

## Introduction

Welcome to out SENG440 Embedded Systems Final project. This repository contains code for converting between different color spaces. The code currently supports Y'PbPr, and Y'CbCr to RGB color space conversion.

## Project Goal

The aim of this project is to improve the efficiency of the existing color space conversion code. This might involve refining the algorithms used, optimizing resource usage, or implementing more efficient data structures. The goal is not only to make the conversions faster, but also to ensure they are accurate and reliable.
